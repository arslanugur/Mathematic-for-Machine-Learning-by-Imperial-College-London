In the following examples, assume all graphs are undirected. 
That is, an edge from A to B is the same as an edge from B to A and counts as exactly one edge.

A clique is an unweighted graph where each node connects to all other nodes. We denote the clique with n nodes as KN. 
Answer the following questions in terms of n.

How many edges are in KN?
---> n * (n - 1)/2
Explanation: 
In a directed graph, each node would connect to all other nodes, yielding n⋅(n−1) edges. 
In our undirected graph, an edge from A to B and from B to A are the same edge, so there are, in fact, half as many.
Alternatively - if you are familiar with the binomial coefficient - see that for each edge, 
you must choose two nodes to connect. Thus there are (n2) = n ⋅ (n−1)/2 edges.


Consider the new version of DFS. 
This traverses paths until all non-circular paths from the source to the destination have been found, and returns the shortest one.
Let A be the source node, and B be the destination in KN. How many paths of length 2 exist from A to B?
---> n - 2
Explanation: 
We have a source A and a destination B. Paths of length 2 contain exactly three three nodes. 
We must select one more node to place in the middle of our path. 
As we cannot select the A or B, we are left with N - 2 choices to construct a path.


How many paths of length 3 exist from A to B?
---> (n - 2) * (n - 3)
Explanation: 
Use the same reasoning as used for the previous problem. 
After knowing our source and destination, we must travel through 2 additional nodes without touching any node twice. 
For the first node, we have n−2 choices, and for the second, we have n−3 choices.
Note that this is equivalent to (n−2)! / (n−4)!


Continuing the logic used above, calculate the number of paths of length m from A to B, where 1 ≤ m ≤ (n − 1), and write this number as a ratio of factorials.
To indicate a factorial, please enter fact(n) to mean n!; fact(n+2) to mean (n+2)!, etc.
---> fact(n - 2) / fact(n - m - 1)
Explanation:
Following the previous problems, it is clear that in choosing our first node between A and B, we have (n−2) choices. 
Similarly, in choosing the second, we have (n−3) choices.
In fact, in choosing the jth node, we have (n−j−1) choices. 
Taking the product from j = 1 to m - 1 (since m - 1 nodes exist between A and B in a path of length m), 
we get (n−2)! / (n−m−1)!

Using the fact that for any n, 1/0!+1/1!+1/2!+...+1n!≤ e for all n, where e is some constant, 
determine the asymptotic bound on the number of paths explored by DFS. 
For simplicity, write O(n) as just n, O(n^2) as n^2, etc.
---> fact(n - 2)
Explanation:
Note that DFS will traverse every path from A to B. 
To calculate the number of paths, we must sum the paths of every length (from 1 to n−1). This sum can be written as:

(n−2)! / (n−2)! + (n−2)! / (n−3)! + (n−2)! / (n−4)! + … + (n−2)! / 0!

This is equal to (n−2)! ⋅ (1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1 / (n−2)!).

Since (1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/(n−2)!) ≤ e, which is a constant, the number of paths is O((n−2)!).
