WARM UP
# Puzzle: Guarini's Puzzle


# Puzzle: Bridges of Königsberg
You are in the 18th century Königsberg, Prussia and your goal is to find
a walk through the city that crosses each of 7 bridges exactly once. 
First, select an island to start your walk followed by selecting bridges in a one-by-one fashion.
Ans: None/Impossible
  
Now, transporting ourselves to today, 
where Königsberg is Kaliningrad in Russia, whose map is shown below. 
Some bridges have been destroyed and some new ones have been built. 
Let us indulge in the same activity.
Is  it possible to plan such a walk in today's Kaliningrad? 
Ans: B --> D --> C --> A --> B 
                             B --> C
                                   C --> D

Why Graphs?
# Drawing Graphs.ipynb

Basic Definitions
# Definitions
Is this graph connected?
Ans: No
this graph is not connected. For example, there is no path between v1 and v3

How many connected components does this graph have?
Ans: 2
this graph has two connected components: {v1,v2,v5,v6,v7,v8} and {v3,v4}

Is there a path from v1 to v6?
Ans: Yes
there are several paths from v1v_1v1​ to v6v_6v6​. One of them is (v1,v5,v6)

What is the distance (the weight of the shortest path) from v1 to v6?
Ans: 2+1+1+4 = 8 --> the shortest path is (v1, v7, v8, v5, v6).
     7+4 = 11    --> longer path is (v1, v6, v6) 

Are these graphs complement?
Ans: Yes
Two vertices on the left are connected if and only if they aren't connected on the right.

Basic Graphs
# Puzzle: Make a Tree
Remove the minimum number of edges from the graph such 
that every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one simple path.
Ans: 6 --> 4 --> 5 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3

Remove the minimum number of edges from the graph such 
that every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one simple path.
Ans: 3 --> 2 --> 7
     3 --> 2 --> 1
     3 --> 6 
     3 --> 4 --> 5

Remove the minimum number of edges from the graph such 
that every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one simple path.
Ans: 3 --> 2 --> 1 --> 4 --> 5

# Graph Types
Is this a complete graph?
v2-------------v3
 |           /  |
 |        /     |
 |     /        |
 |  /           |
v1-------------v4
Ans: No
there is no edge between v2 and v4, thus, this graph is not complete.


Is this a tree?
v1 ----  v2 -- v3 -- v4 -- v5
          |                |
           ----------------
Ans: No
this graph contains a cycle (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v1), so it's not a tree.

The Graph is complete and cycle
v1--------v2
 |---v3---|
Complete: there is an edge between every pair of vertices.
Cycle: this is the cycle on three vertices.


The Graph is bipartite
   v2
  /
v1----v3
  \
   v4
Bipartite - one part of this graph contains only the central vertex, while the other part contains all the remaining vertices. 
            Every edge connects two vertices from different parts.
