Combinations with Repetitions
# Salads
"""
We have an unlimited supply of tomatoes, bell peppers and lettuce. 
We want to make a salad out of 4 units among these three ingredients (we do not have to use all ingredients). 
The order in which we use the ingredients does not matter. 
How many different salads we can make? 
We do not have the formula to answer this question yet, 
so try to list all the salads first or create a program that will do that for you. 
Then you can count the number of salads by hand (note the answer to the problem should be the number).
Ans: 15
the code that lists all salads (T=tomato, B=bell pepper, L=lettuce) """
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
Code:
for c in combinations_with_replacement("TBL", 4):
    print("".join(c))

# Combinations with Repetitions
Twenty people are voting for one of 5 candidates. 
They have secret ballot, each voter votes for one of 5 candidates. 
The result of an election is the number of votes for each of the candidate. 
How many possible results can this vote have 
(the result of the vote is determined by the number of votes for each candidate)?
Ans: 10626
Each vote picks one out of five candidates. 
Since we have a secret ballot, votes are unordered. 
There are repetitions, since each candidate can be voted for more than once. 
Thus we are dealing with combinations of size 20 out of 5 options with repetitions. 
So the answer to the problem is (20+(5−1) matrix 5−1) = (24 matrix 4).

We have 9 identical candies and we want to distribute them between 3 different sections of our bag. 
It does not matter which candies go to which section. 
How many ways do we have to do it?
Ans: 55
With each candy we pick one of three sections. 
Thus we have a selection of size 9 among 3 options. 
Candies are identical, so the order does not matter. 
We allow repetitions: several candies can go into the same section. 
Thus we are dealing with combinations of size 7 out of 3 options with repetitions. 
So the answer is a binomial coefficient with the parameters 9+(3-1) = 11 and 3-1 = 2


Problems in Combinatorics
# Distributing Assignments Among People
Suppose there are 4 people and 9 different assignments. 
Each person should receive one assignment. 
Assignments for different people should be different. 
How many ways are there to do it?
Ans: 3024

There are 4 people and 9 different assignments. 
We need to distribute all assignments among people. 
No assignment should be assigned to two people. 
Every person can be given arbitrary number of assignments from 0 to 9. 
How many ways are there to do it?
Ans: 262144
It is convenient to look from the position of assignments. 
Each assignment has to receive a person who will work on it. 
Each assignment has 4 options. 
Assignments are different, so these are ordered selections. 
Repetitions are allowed: two assignments can be given to the same person. 
So we are dealing with tuples.

# Distributing Candies Among Kids
There are 15 identical candies. 
How many ways are there to distribute them among 7 kids?
Ans: 54264

There are 15 identical candies. 
How many ways are there to distribute them among 7 kids 
in such a way that each kid receives at least 1 candy?
Ans: 3003
We can just give one candy to each kid. 
This way we will satisfy the requirement (note that we have to give out these candies). 
Now for the remaining candies we have exactly the same situation as in the previous problem. 
With each of 8 remaining candies we pick one of the kids. 
Order does not matter, repetitions are allowed. 
Thus we have combinations of size 8 out of 7 options with repetitions.


# Numbers with Fixed Sum of Digits
How many non-negative integer numbers are there below 10000 
such that their sum of digits is equal to 9?
Ans: 220
it is convenient to look from the point of view of digits in the number. 
There are four digits in the number and we split the weight 9 among them. 
We can start with all digits being equal to 0 and then add 1 to one of them nine times in a row. 
So, each time we have to pick one of four digits. 
These choices are unordered and the repetitions are allowed. 
So we are dealing with combinations of size 9 out of 4 options 
with repetitions and we have the formula for that.

How many non-negative integer numbers are there below 10000 
such that their sum of digits is equal to 10?
Ans: 282
We can start similarly to the previous problem. 
There are four digits in the number and we split the weight 10 among them. 
We can start with all digits being equal to 0 and then add 1 to one of them nine times in a row. 
So, each time we have to pick one of four digits. 
These choices are unordered and the repetitions are allowed. 
So we are dealing with combinations of size 10 out of 4 options 
with repetitions and we have the formula for that. This gives 286. 
But note that we have also counted cases where we place weight 10 into one digit 
and these cases do not correspond to 4-digit numbers. 
There are four such cases and subtracting them 
from our intermediate result we obtain the answer to the problem.

# Numbers with Non-increasing Digits
How many four-digit numbers are there such that their digits are non-increasing, 
that is each next digit is not greater than the previous one?
Three-digit numbers are also four-digit, they just start with 0.
Ans: 715
To fix such a number it is sufficient and enough to pick unordered subset of four numbers from 0 to 9. 
Then they can be ordered into a non-increasing order in a unique way. 
Since there might be equal digits in our number, repetitions are allowed. 
Thus we are dealing with combinations of size 4 out of 10 options with repetitions.

# Splitting into Working Groups
There are 12 students in the class. 
How many ways are there to split them 
into working groups of size 2 to work on the same assignment?
Ans: 10395


# Problems in Combinatorics
Alice has 7 different textbooks. 
She would like to lend three books to Bob for a weekend. 
How many ways does she have to do it?
Ans: 35
Alice has to pick 3 books out of 7 books she has. 
The order does not matter and she cannot pick the same book twice. 
So we have combinations of size 3 out of 7 objects. 
There are 7x6x5/(3x2x1)=7x5=35 of them.


Alice has 7 textbooks and Bob has 5 textbooks. 
All textbooks are different. 
They would like to exchange three books each between each other for a weekend. 
That is, Alice gives Bob three of her books and Bob gives Alice three of his books. 
How many ways do they have to do it?
Ans: 350
When each of them pick three books among their N books (N=7 for Alice and N=5 for Bob), 
we are dealing with combinations: unordered selection without repetitions. 
Thus Alice can pick three books in 7x6x5/(3x2x1)=7x5=35 ways 
and Bob can pick three books in 5x4x3/(3x2x1)=10 ways. 
Since we want both Alice and Bob to choose books, we are dealing with pairs of choices, 
so we have to multiply variants for both people.


Five married couples are planning a barbecue. 
They need to pick three couples who will be responsible for bringing food. 
How many ways do they have to do it?
Ans: 10
We pick three couples out of five without repetitions and order.
These are combinations of size three out of five options.


Five married couples are planning a barbecue. 
They need to hold a meeting dedicated to the planning. 
The meeting should consist of five people, one from each couple. 
How many possible ways do they have to pick people for the meeting?
Ans: 32
Indeed, in each couple they have to pick one person. 
There are two ways to do this. 
Since this have to be repeated five times separately, 
we have to apply the product rule and multiply 2 by itself five times. 
Note, that we are dealing with tuples here: 
we pick a sequence of length 5, 
where each position in the sequence correspond to one of the couple, 
and we have two options for each position, two members of the couple.

Five married couples gathered for a barbecue. 
They need to pick three people among them who will be responsible for preparing the table. 
But they do not want to pick two people from the same couple for this (this would not be fair). 
How many ways do they have to pick three people satisfying this requirement?
Ans: 80
Indeed, due to the restriction we have to pick three persons from different couples. 
For this we first have to pick three couples, 
from which we are going to choose people for our task. 
And then we have to pick one person from each of the three couples. 
We can make the first choice in 10 ways (compare with Question 3 of the test) 
and then we can pick one person in each of the three couples. 
We can do it in 8 ways (compare with Question 4 of this test). 
Each pair of choices on two stages above result in a different pick of people to prepare the table. 
So by the product rule in total we have 10 x 8 = 80 possibilities.


In a 6 number lottery one is trying 
to guess an unordered subset of 6 numbers among 44 numbers without repetitions. 
For this one picks 6 numbers out of 44 himself. 
How many ways are there to do this? You can use wolfram alpha to compute the exact number.
Ans: 7059052
We have to pick a subset of size 6 out of 44 options. 
These are combinations and the answer is a binomial coefficient.


In a 6 number lottery one is trying 
to guess an unordered subset of 6 numbers among 44 numbers without repetitions. 
After the lottery the organisers decided 
to count how many possible ways are there to guess correctly exactly three numbers. 
What is the answer to this question? 
You can use wolfram alpha to compute the exact number.
Ans: 168720
Since the lottery has already happened, the set of winning numbers is fixed. 
So to guess exactly three winning numbers one has to pick three numbers among 6 winning numbers 
and pick 3 other numbers among remaining 44-6=38 numbers. 
Choices for both cases can be computed as binomial coefficients 
and then we have to multiply the results by the product rule.

Also note that if we divide this number by the answer to the previous problem we get approximately 0.024. 
As we will discuss next week this is the probability to guess exactly three numbers correctly, 
that is the chances are 2.4%.
