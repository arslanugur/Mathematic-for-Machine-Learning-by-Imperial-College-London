Random Variables and Expectations
# Random Variables
Suppose we throw a dice with numbers from 1 to 6 on its sides two times in a row. 
In the following list pick those elements that are random variables (and not events).
---> The sum of numbers on both dices. That's right! Here we assign a number to each outcome of our random event.
---> The difference between numbers on the first and the second throw. 
     That's right! Here we assign a number to each outcome of our random event.
---> The number on the first dice. That's right! Here we assign a number to each outcome of our random event.


Suppose we toss a coin two times in a row. Consider the random variable that is equal to the number of heads in these throws. 
What is the probability of the event that this random variable has value 1?
Ans: 1/2
There are four possible outcomes: (heads, heads), (heads, tails), (tails, heads), (tails, tails). 
And two of them fall in our event: (heads, tails) and (tails, heads)


# Average
Suppose number a is at least 1 and at most 5, and number b is at least 2 and at most 7. 
What is the smallest possible value for the average of a and b?
Ans: 1/2
Indeed, the smaller the numbers a and b are, the smaller is their average. 
So the smallest value of average is achieved when a=1 and b=2. The average is then (1+2)/2=3/2


Suppose number a is at least 1 and at most 5, and number b is at least 2 and at most 7. 
What is the largest possible value for the average of a and b?
Ans: 6
Indeed, the larger the numbers a and b are, the larger is their average. 
So the largest value of average is achieved when a=5 and b=7. 
The average is then (5+7)/2=6


Student got scores 78, 85, 87 and 93 on four tests. What is his average score?
Ans: 343/4
To compute the average we need to add up all his results and divide by the number of tests.


Suppose we throw a coin many times. 
Consider a random variable that is equal to 1 if the outcome of a throw is 'tails' and that is 0 
if the outcome is 'heads'. 
What is the approximate value of an average outcome?
Ans: 1/2
If we throw a coin n times, then in approximately n/2 cases the value of the random variable is 1 
and in approximately n/2 cases it is 0. Thus, the average is (1 × n/2 + 0 × n/2) / n = 1/2


# Expectations
Consider a random variable with outcomes 0 and 1 having probabilities 1/3 and 2/3 respectively. 
What is the expected value of this random variable?
Ans: 2/3
Indeed by the formula we have that the expected value is equal to 0 × 1/3 + 1 × 2/3 = 2/3


Consider a random variable with outcomes 1, 3 and 4 having probabilities 1/4, 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. 
What is the expected value of this random variable?
Ans: 11/4
Indeed by the formula we have that the expected value is equal to 1 × 1/4 + 3 × 1/2 + 4 × 1/4 = 11/4



Linearity of Expectation
# Linearity of Expectation
Suppose we throw a coin 4 times in a row. What is the expected number of tails in these throws?
Ans: 2
Indeed, for each throw we can consider a random variable that is equal to 1 if the outcome is `tails' and that is equal to 0 if the outcome is `heads'.
Then the number of tails as a random variable is equal to the sum of these random variables over all outcomes. 
The expectation of each of introduced random variables is equal to 1/2 as computed in the video. 
So the expectation of the sum is equal to 4 × 1/2 = 2


Suppose we throw a dice 4 times in a row. What is the expected number of outcomes 1 in these throws?
Ans: 2/3
Indeed, for each throw we can consider a random variable that is equal to 1 if the outcome is `one' and that is equal to 0 for all other outcomes. 
Then the number of outcomes 1 as a random variable is equal to the sum of these random variables over all outcomes. 
The probability of the value 1 for our random variables is 1/6 and the probability of the value 0 is 5/6. 
Thus the expectation of each of introduced random variables is equal to 1× 1/6 + 0 × 5/6 = 1/6. 
So the expectation of the sum is equal to 4 × 1/6 = 2/3


# Bob's Party
Bob has a birthday and is throwing a party for his friends. He invited 30 people to the party. 
From the previous experience Bob knows that each of his friends will show up to the party with probability 2/5 independently of others. 
What is the expected number of guests on Bob’s party?
Ans: 12
Indeed, the number of guests at the party is the random variable. 
To compute its expectation it is convenient to break this random variable into the sum of 30 more simple random variables.
For this for each friend of Bob that he invited to the party introduce a random variable that
is equal to 1 if this person showed up at the party and is equal to 0 otherwise. 
Then the number of guest who showed up at the party is equal to the sum of all 30 of these random variables. 
For each of the guest the probability that the corresponding value is equal to 1 is 2/5.
So the expectation of each of our simple random variables is equal to 2/5. 
So the expected number of guests at the party is 30 × 2/5 = 12



# More Linearity
Suppose we toss a coin 20 times in a row. 
We are considering how many times it happens that we have an outcome `heads' and the next outcome is `tails'. 
This is a random variable since it depends on outcome of our tosses. 
What is the expectation of this random variable?
Ans: 19/4
In case of this problem it is gets really hard to compute this expectation directly. But linearity helps. 
For each ii from 1 to 19 we can consider the random variable that
is equal to 1 of we have `heads' in the throw number i and `tails' in the throw number i+1 and is equal to 0 otherwise. 
Then we can observe that the random value in the formulation of the problem is the sum of our 19 new random variables. 
The probability that a new random variable obtains value 1 is 1/4, since we need two coins to give us specific outcomes. 
The probability of this variable to be 0 is this 3/4.
So the expectation of new variables is 1 × 1/4 + 0 × 3/4 = 1/4.
Since there are 19 of these random variables the expectation of their sum is 19 × 1/4 = 19/4



Markov's Inequality
# Average Income
An internet article claims that 10% of citizens of a certain country earn 
at least 15 times more money than the average income in this country. Can it be the case?
Ans: No, this is impossible
Indeed, suppose the statement is true. 
Denote the number of people in the country by n and the average income by s.
Then the total income of all people in the country is n × s. 
And if we consider 10% of the population from the formulation of the problem, 
their total income is at least n/10 × 15 × s 
(the number of people in this group is n/10 
and their individual income is at least 15 × s). 
This amount is greater than the total income of the population which gives a contradiction.


# Bob's Party Revisited
Bob has a birthday and is throwing a party for his friends. 
He invited 30 people to the party. 
From the previous experience Bob knows that each of his friends 
will show up to the party with probability 2/5 independently of others. 
Recall that we already have computed before the expected number of guests at the party and it is equal to 12. 
Bob is deciding how much snacks will be at the party 
and he would like to upper bound the probability that there will be at least 18 people. 
What upper bound on this probability can he get from Markov’s inequality?
Ans: 2/3
Indeed we have a random variable f that is the number of people at the party. 
This is a non-negative random variable and its expectation is  Ef = 12.
By Markov’s inequality Pr[f ≥ 18] ≤ Ef/18 = 2/3.


# Alice's Tests
Alice makes 3 mistakes on average on a random test in the course she is taking. 
What is the best upper bound we can get from Markov’s inequality on the probability that 
she will make at least 15 mistakes?
The answer to the problem should be a number between 0 and 1 (not a percent).
Ans: 1/5
Number of mistakes f by Alice on a random test is a random variable. 
This is a non-negative random variable and its expectation is 3. 
So, by Markov’s inequality Pr[f ≥ 15] ≤ Ef/15 = 1/5.
Note that given the information from the formulation of the problem 
this is the best bound on the probability of this event we can hope for. 
Indeed, it might be the case that Alice makes exactly 15 mistakes with probability 1/5 
and makes 0 mistakes with probability 4/5. 
This does not contradict to the statement of the problem: 
the expectation then is exactly 3. 
And also in this case Pr[f ≥ 15] = 1/5.
So our bound is tight.
