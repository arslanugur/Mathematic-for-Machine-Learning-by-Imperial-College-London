# Concentration for Galton Board
What is the fraction of beans 
that end near the center (bins 40-60 among 0-100) for the ideal Galton board with 100 layers?  
(You may try to write a program, or use some scientific computations tool. 
For such a problem wolfram alpha should be enough.)
Ans: between 95% and 97%
Yes, about 96,5%; try sum_k=40^60 (100 choose k) / 2^100 on wolfram alpha

# Computing Probabilities for Two Dice
Consider again the setting with red and blue dice where all 36 pairs are equiprobable. 
Consider the event "red and blue numbers are different". 
How many favourable outcomes do we have for this event (out of 36) 
Ans: 30
We have 6 not favourable ones (11,22,...,66)

In the same setting with 36 (red, blue) outcomes we consider the sum of two numbers (on two dice). 
What is the most probable value of this sum?
Ans: 7
Indeed, each value correspond to some diagonal in the table, 
and 7 corresponds to the longest one (6 of 36)

What is more probable while rolling two dice: to get at least one six, or to have no sixes?
Ans: Having no sixes is more probable
No sixes happen in 25 cases (5 times 5) out of 36, and 25/36 > 1/2 
(so we have only 36-25=11 favorable outcomes for the other event)


Probability: Do's and Don't's
# Fair Decisions and Imperfect Coins
Assume that some dice has six outcomes 
with probabilities p_1 = 1/10, p_2 = 2/5, p_3 = 1/5, p_4 = 1/10, p_5 = 1/10, p_6 = 1/10.  
You and a friend came to the restaurant 
and want to roll this dice once to decide who pays, so that both have equal chances. 
Can this be done? [Here "dice" stands for one cube, may be may be better to use "die" instead, sorry]
Ans: Yes
Indeed, the outcome "1 or 2" has probability 1/10+2/5=0.1+0.4=0.5.

Assume that a dice [=die] has six outcomes 
with probabilities p_1 = 1/10, p_2 = 2/5, p_3 = 1/5, p_4 = 1/10, p_5 = 1/10, p_6 = 1/10. 
You and two friends came to the restaurant 
and want to roll this dice once to decide who pays, 
so that all three eaters have equal chances. Can this be done?
Ans: No
Indeed, the probabilities of individual outcomes are finite decimal fractions, 
so the probablity of any event (their sum) is also a finite decimal fraction, 
so we cannot get 1/3=0.33333... exactly.

Now you want to design a (six-face) dice [=die] 
(any non-negative p_1,....,p_6​ with sum 1 are allowed) 
that can be used for two, three or four people (rolling the dice once, 
we can provide equal chances for all eaters). Is it possible?
Ans: Yes
Consider the sum 1/4+1/12+1/6+1/6+1/12+1/4. 
You may now group it into groups with sum 1/4 (note than 1/12+1/6=1/4), 
or into groups with sum 1/3  (1/4+1/12=1/6+1/6=1/3). 
This is enough. 
(What happens if you cut the same log into three and four pieces not moving the pieces inbetween?)

Now you want to design a (6-face) dice [=die] 
(any non-negative p_1,…,p_6 with sum 1 are allowed) 
that can be used for two, three, four or five people 
(rolling the dice once, we can provide equal chances for all eaters). 
Is it possible?
Ans: No, such a dice does not exist
Indeed, if there is a division into five groups, 
and the total number of outcomes is 6, 
then there should be at least four isolated outcomes (events with only one outcome) of size 1/5. 
Then this pieces make fair division for four impossible, 
since each of them should go into its own group, and 1/20 is missing, 
while we have only two pieces that can be used to fill the gap.


# Prisoner and King
A King decides to give a prisoner a chance of being set free. 
The king places two boxes, 15 white, and 15 black balls on the table. 
The prisoner can distribute the balls between two boxes in any way with the 
only constraint that no box is empty. 
After this, the king picks one of the boxes with probability 1/2 each, 
and picks a random ball from that box (each ball is picked with equal probability). 
If the ball happens to be white, then the prisoner is freed. 
Distribute the balls between the two boxes to maximize prisoner’s chances.
                First box Second box
White balls     1         14
Black balls     0         15

# Inclusion-Exclusion Formula
It is known that two events A and B in some probability space have probabilities 0.7 and 0.8. 
What is the minimal possible probability of an event "A and B" (the intersection of both events)?
Ans: 0.5
Recall the inclusion and exclusion formula: Pr[A or B]=Pr[A]+Pr[B]-Pr[A and B]. 
This probability could not exceed 1, and Pr[A]+Pr[B]=1.5, so Pr[A and B] should be at least 0.5. 
This is indeed possible (if A and B together cover the entire space)

It is known that two events A and B in some probability space have probabilities 0.7 and 0.8. 
What is the maximal possible probability of an event "A and B" (the intersection of both events)?
Ans: 0.7
This happens when A is a part of B (and this is the maximal possible probability, since "A and B" is a part of A

Conditional Probability
# Computing Conditional Probabilities
We roll a dice with 6 equiprobable outcomes. Compute the conditional probability 
Pr⁡[outcome is odd ∣ outcome is even]
Ans: 0
There are no odd outcomes among even outcomes, of course

Six people form a queue, including A and B (all 6! orderings are equiprobable). 
What is the probability that B is before A under the condition that A is not the first?
Ans: 3/5 
The event "B is before A" is a part of the event "A is not the first"; 
So the answer is Pr[B is before A]/Pr[A is not the first]=(1/2)/(5/6)=3/5

We roll two dice (all 36 outcomes are equiprobable). 
What is the conditional probability to have 1 on the first dice 
under the condition that the sum of two numbers is 6?
Ans: 1/5
There are 5 outcomes when the sum is 6 (from (1,5) to (5,1)), 
among them there is one outcome that has 1 on the first dice

Recall the puzzle about the prisoner and the king. 
Imagine that the prisoner puts 1 white ball in one box, and 14 white and 15 black balls in the other box. 
Then the king chooses a random box and then chooses a random ball inside this box. 
What is the conditional probability of the event "the king chooses the second box" 
under the condition "the ball chosen by the king was white"?
Ans: 14/43
Indeed, the probability of the event "king chooses the white ball from the second box" (the intersection) 
is (1/2)(14/29)=14/58, while the probability to choose the white ball (from whatever box) is 1/2+14/58=43/58.


# Prisoner, King and Conditional Probabilities
There are two boxes; 
the first one contains 10 white balls and 5 black balls; 
the other one contains 10 black balls and 5 white balls. 
King randomly selects a box (with equal probabilities) 
and then randomly takes a ball from this box (with equal probabilities). 
What  is the probability that King selected the first box 
under the condition that the ball he selected is white?
Ans: 2/3
This can be obtained by Bayes theorem. 
However, in this case the answer can be easily seen: 
the boxes have equal amount of balls, so all balls are equiprobable. 
Note that 15 white balls (equiprobable) are distributed as 10+5, so 2/3 of them is are the first box.

# More Conditional Probabilities
Mary tosses the coin three times. 
What is conditional probability of the event "all tails" under the condition "at least two tails"?
Ans: 1/4

[IMPORTANT: there was a wrong answer for this problem, now corrected. Apologies...] 
The conditional probability Pr[B|A] is 4/5; 
the conditional probability P[B|not A] is 2/5, and the unconditional probability of B is 1/2. 
What is the probability of A?
Ans: 1/4

# More About Independence
Two events A and B are independent, Pr[A}=p, Pr[B]=q. What is the probability of the event "A and B"?
Ans: p*q
This is just the definition of independence

Two events A and B are independent, Pr[A}=p, Pr[B]=q. What is the probability of the event "A or B"?
Ans: p+q-p*q or -pq+p+q
Recall the inclusion-exclusion formula

Two events A and B are independent, Pr[A}=p, Pr[B]=q. What is the probability of the event "neither A nor B"?
Ans: 1-p-q+p*q or pq-p-q+1

Two events A and B are independent. Does it imply that the events "not A" and "B" are independent?
Ans: Yes, because Pr[not A|something]=1-Pr[A|something}: 
if condition B does not change the probability of A, it also does not change the probability of "not A"


Two events A and B are independent. Does it imply that the events "not A" and "not B" are independent?
Ans: Yes
Sure, it follows from the statement of the previous question, used twice

Events A and C are independent. Events B and C are independent. 
Does it imply that the event (A and B) and the event C are independent?
Ans: No, it is not always that case
Indeed, consider the two coin tosses and the events "first head", "second head" and "only one head"

                                           
                                           
# Computing Probabilities: More Examples
Six people, including A,B, and C, form a queue in a random order (all 6! orderings are equiprobable). 
Consider the event "A is the first in the queue". 
(This event does not mention B, C or other people in the queue: they will appear in the other questions.) 
What is its probability? [Warning: the exact answer, not a decimal approximation, is needed.]
Ans: 1/6
All queues can be split into six classes depending on who is the first. 
All the classes have the same cardinality, so each is 1/6 of the total space.


Again six people, including A,B, and C, form a queue in a random order (all 6! orderings are equiprobable). 
Consider the event "A precedes B in the queue". (Again this event does not mention C or other people in the queue. 
It happens when A is closer to the start of the queue than B, 
and does not require that B is the next after A, some people could be between A and B.) 
What is the probability of this event?
Ans: 1/2
Indeed, there are two types of queues: where A precedes B and vice versa. 
For symmetry reasons these two classes have the same number of elements.


Again six people, including A,B, and C, form a queue in a random order (all 6! orderings are equiprobable). 
Consider the event "B is between A and C in the queue". 
What is its probability? (The order of A and C can be arbitrary, but B should be between them)
Ans: 1/3
Again we divide all outcomes (queues) in three classes: 
where A in between B and C, where B is between C and A, and where C is between A and B. 
(Exactly one person among these three is between two others).


Again six people, including A,B, and C, form a queue in a random order (all 6! orderings are equiprobable). 
Consider the event "A and B are neighbors in the queue". What is its probability?
Ans: 1/3
Here we cannot use the symmetry (at least I don't see how this helps). 
If the position of A and B (their ordinal numbers in the queue) are fixed, then there are 4! outcomes. 
To fix the position where A and B are neighbors, 
we choose between 5*2 positions (there could be 0..4 people before them and there are two orderings of A and B - A may be before B or after). 
So we get 5⋅2⋅4!/6! = 1/3.



Monty Hall Paradox
# Monty Hall Gone Crazy
Imagine that now host have the following instructions. 
Put a prize behind a random door. Let the guest guess a door. 
1) If the guest chooses an incorrect door (with no prize), 
   roll a dice (in such a way that the guest does not see this and does not know whether this happened);  
a) with probability 1/3 (outcomes 1 and 2) open the door (that has no prize behind); the game ends;
b) with probability 2/3 (outcomes 3,4,5,6) open the other door with no prize and ask the guest 
   whether she wants to change the guess.  
2) if the guest chooses a correct door (with a prize), 
   open one of the two other doors (making a random choice) and ask the guest whether she wants to change the guess.
What is the probability for the guest to get a prize if she uses "change" strategy (i.e., changes the guess)? 
We consider the fraction of winning days among all days (when she was given a chance to change or when she was not).
Ans: 4/9
In 2/3 of the days the initial guess was wrong. 
With probability 2/3, i.e., in 4/9 of all the days, 
the guest will be given a chance to change the guess and will win (assuming the "change" strategy is used). 
In 1/3 of the days the initial guess is correct, and then the "change" stategy fails. 


The same scenario is used (as in the previous exercise). 
Put a prize behind a random door. Let the guest guess a door. 
1) If the guest chooses an incorrect door (with no prize), 
   roll a dice (in such a way that the guest does not see this and does not know whether this happened);
a) with probability 1/3 (outcomes 1 and 2) open the door (that has no prize behind); the game ends;
b) with probability 2/3 (outcomes 3,4,5,6) open the other door with no prize and ask the guest 
   whether she wants to change the guess.
2) if the guest chooses a correct door (with a prize), 
   open one of the two other doors (making a random choice) and ask the guest whether she wants to change the guess.
What is the probability for the guest to get a prize if she uses "keep" strategy (i.e., does not change the guess)? 
We consider the fraction of winning days among all day (when she was given a chance to change or when she was not).
Ans: 1/3
