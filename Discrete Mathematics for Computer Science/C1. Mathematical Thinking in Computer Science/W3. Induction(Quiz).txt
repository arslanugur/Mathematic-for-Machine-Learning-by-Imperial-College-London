1. Question 1
      What is the formula for the sum of all integers from 5 to n, where n≥5n?
      
      (n+5)(n−4) / 2

2. Question 2
      Find the formula for the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-3) + (2n-1)
      
      n^2
      
3. Question 3
      Function T is defined by T(0) = a,T(n+1) = T(n)+b. What is the correct formula for T(n)?
	
      T(n) = a + nb
      
4. Question 4
      Function T(n) is defined by T(0) =a,T(n+1) = b*T(n). What is the correct formula for T(n)?
		
      T(n) = ab^n

5. Question 5
      Recall the recursive formula for the minimum number of moves in the Hanoi Towers problem: 
      T(1) = 1,T(n+1) = 2T(n)+1, where T(n) is the minimum number of moves for Hanoi Towers with n disks. 
      What is the correct formula for T(n)?

      T(n) = 2^n -1
      
6. Question 6
      You have $1000 on day 1, and every day you earn 10% of what you already get,
      so that on day 2 you have $1000+10%*$1000 = $1 100, and on day 3 you have $1 100+10%*$1 100 = $1 210. 
      On which day you will have more than $1000000 for the first time? 
      Feel free to use the notebook about Bernoulli's inequality that we provided in this lesson.

      On day 74
      
7. Question 7
      What is the flaw in the following proof?
      Claim: For any integer n≥0 and any positive integer a, a^n = 1.
      Proof by Induction.
      Induction base: n = 0, so a^n = a^0=1.
      Induction step: If the statement is true for all n up to m, then it is true for n = m+1.
      a^m+1 = a^m*a^m / a^m-1 != 1⋅1 / 1 = 1
      Where we marked by "!" the assumption of the induction that a^m = 1 and a^m−1 = 1.

      We are using the assumption of the induction for both m and m−1, ,
      so we must have proved induction base for at least two different values of n-0 and 1.

8. Question 8
      Function T(n) is defined as T(0) = 0,T(2n) = T(n)+1,T(2n+1) = T(n)+1. 
      What is the correct formula for T(n)?

      T(n) = k, where k is the smallest non-negative integer such that 2^k>n.

9. Question 9
      What is the value of the sum 1/1*2 + 1/2*3 + 1/3*4 + ... + 1/ 99*100?
      0.99
